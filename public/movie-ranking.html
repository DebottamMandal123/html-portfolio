<h1>The Best Movies Acccording to Me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Wolf of the Wall Street</h3>
<p>For me this is the best movie of Leonardo DiCaprio for which 
    he should have gotten the oscar for not revenant 
</p>
<h3>The Irishmen</h3>
<p>Nothing to describe about this.
    The cast itself speaks volume and gravity of the movie
</p>
<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>
    I dont think there is a single engineering student in India
    who has not watched this Rajkumar Hirani masterpiece
    The way it portrayed the troubles and perils of 
    the students made it so relatble for evrybody 
    as most people has grown through that phase in 
    their life.
    <br/>
    To me this is one of the best movies of all time,
    the other two may change in future but 
    I don't think this one will,atleast for a long time
